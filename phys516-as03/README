mean.c: Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm is just a fancy sample-mean MC, so we
  use a simple sample-mean MC code, mean.c, as a starting point. Instead of a simple
  linear-congruential recursion to generate uniform random numbers in mean.c,
  your program (let's name it ising.c) uses the Metropolis attempt/accept procedure
  to generate a Markov chain of nonuniform random numbers according to the Boltzmann
  distribution.
