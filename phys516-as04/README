This folder (phys516-as04) contains instruction and code needed to complete assignment 4
for PHYS 516.

as04.pdf: Assignment itself.

VAC.pdf: Note on velocity autocorrelation function (VAC).

md.c, md.h, md.in: C program, header file and input file for basic molecular dynamics
simulation, which will be modified by you to compute VAC.
To compile the program into an executable named md, type
  cc -O -o md md.c -lm
in your terminal. Here, we have used a compiler option, -O, to optimize the performance.
To run the executable, type
  ./md < md.in
by redirecting the input-parameter file, md.in, into the standard input of the program.
